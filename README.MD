Linear regression modeling for General Assembly Data Science Course

Part 1: Use the first three columns to predict the number of doctors visits with a linear regression model.

Part 2: Build a linear model that only takes age and education years as the input; then a linear model that takes just the age and the income. Which model fits the data better? Graph data with both of those regression lines using pylab or matplotlib to visualize the results.

Part 3: Check that the two linear models from Part 2 and the linear model from Part 1 predict different values for the number of visits given some test data. 

ANSWER: The two models from Part 2 do yield different values. I don't understand the graphs however. 

Is the variation in the predictions consistent with your intuition?
Somewhat. The strongest predictor is probably age alone.
